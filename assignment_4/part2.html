		<h3>A Brief History of CSS</h3>
		<p>CSS is one of three foundational web technologies (the other two are HTML and JavaScript). 
			CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets — the key terms are 'cascading' and 'style,' 
			with cascading referring to the way that one style may cascade into another. 
			One of the several advantages of CSS is that multiple styles may be used inside a single HTML document.
			<br>CSS is used to define how HTML code will appear on a website. While HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to provide content, 
			such as written text, CSS is used to modify the appearance of a web page.
			Thus, depending on the data being displayed, a developer may opt for a page with tabs running across the top or along the side.
			<br>Alternatively, another developer may opt to employ headers and sub heading styles to guarantee that the text jump off the page, or may completely redesign or redesign an existing webpage.
			Perhaps the easiest way to describe what CSS works is to illustrate what a page would look like without it.
			Without CSS, online sites are bland and uninspiring. The text scrolls over the entire page, making it impossible to read. 
			<br>However, before to the advent of CSS, this was the appearance of online pages.
			CSS's debut contributed to the way the web appears and feels today. And, far from being formed and therefore complete, it is a language that is always changing.

		<h3>Why are we in need of CSS?</h3>
		<p>To begin, CSS maintains the consistency of your web pages. Consider a website with hundreds of pages; now consider having to input code to determine header sizes, layout, 
			and other display data and mixing it all in with the content whenever you wished to create a new page. 
			<br>Additionally, consider having a site with hundreds of pages and being able to update only one of them while leaving the others the same — CSS enables this. 
			<br>CSS provides uniformity where it is required while remaining flexible enough to allow for adjustments to particular pages or parts.
		</p>
		<p>By utilizing CSS, a user may indicate:</p>
		<ul class="center">
			<li>Fonts</li>
			<li>The color of the text and hyperlinks</li>
			<li>Utilize color in the backdrop of the text</li>
			<li>Where and how boxes appear and are arranged inside the content</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Furthermore, CSS enhances user accessibility, efficiency, and flexibility, while also ensuring browser compatibility.</p>
		<h3>Who was the inventor of CSS?</h3>
		<p>
			According to Wikipedia, Håkan Wium Lie of Norway is mainly responsible for the origin of CSS, since he intended to build a universally uniform style sheet for the World Wide Web in 1994.
			<br>Lie's first site on which he tested CSS was the Arena web browser. From its inception, Lie collaborated with Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau to build CSS1, CSS2, and RFC 2318 versions. 
			<br>CSS, in all of its standards, became an established online standard during its first decade of existence (1994-2004), significantly affecting the appearance and accessibility of the world wide web as we know it today. 
			<br><strong>CSS3</strong> was first published in 1999. Web standards are a subject dear to Lie's heart. Since providing CSS, he has petitioned major technology companies such as Microsoft and other browser vendors to adopt common web standards and has continued to improve CSS's usage for online printing and screen pagination.
