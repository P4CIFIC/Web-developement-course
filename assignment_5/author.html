			<h2>J. R. R. Tolkien</h2>
			<h3>A Breif Summary of the Work & Personal Life of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien</h3>
            <img alt="A portrait of Tolkien" src="Tolkien.jpg">
			<h3>Early Life</h3>
			<p>
                Tolkien was born the <em>3rd of January 1892</em> into a wealthy, Roman Catholic family. Not
                long after Tolkien's birth, his father died of Rheumatic fever. For some reason after his
                father's death Tolkien was like: "Dude, I wanna go to Switzerland...", and so he did. His journey
                through Switzerland was pretty cool, Tolkien thought. He unsurprisingly drew a lot of inspiration
                from his journey as illustrated in his books, most prominently <strong>The Hobbit</strong>.<br>
