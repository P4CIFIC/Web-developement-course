			<h2>External vs. Internal vs. Inline CSS</h2>
			<p>
				Inline styles are applied by the use of the style attribute in an <i>HTML</i> tag, 
				with the value of the attribute being the CSS file. Internal styles are applied to 
				an <i>HTML</i> page through the use of the <i>style</i> tag, with CSS placed between the opening 
				and closing tags. In an <i>HTML</i> page, external styles are applied by using the <i>link</i> tag, 
				which has a <i>href</i> property that links to the URL of a CSS file that is included in the page.<br>
				The great differentiator between inline <i>CSS</i> and external stylesheets is a very simple fact.
				Inline <i>CSS</i> being what it is makes usability impossible, while external sheets can be reused 
				again and again only being constrained by the layout of the <i>HTML</i> document.
				Styling web pages using inline <i>CSS</i> hinders scalability, readability and maintainability. 
				Inline <i>CSS</i> isn't totally useless though, there is a place and time for fast prototyping 
				simple web pages. One could also see the possiblity of using inline <i>CSS</i> for styling very unique 
				<i>HTML</i> elements.<br> 
				Internal <i>CSS</i> provides a balance between the two styling methods, 
				and in my opinion nullifies the utility of inline <i>CSS</i>. Lastly, I would like to express my 
				bias towards external <i>CSS</i> as it has  proven to be the most useful method for styling 
				for my particular workflow.
