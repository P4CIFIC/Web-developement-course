			<h2>Inline vs. External CSS</h2>
			<p>
				Inline styles are applied by the use of the style attribute in an HTML tag, 
				with the value of the attribute being the CSS file. Internal styles are applied to 
				an HTML page through the use of the <i>style</i> tag, with CSS placed between the opening 
				and closing tags. In an HTML page, external styles are applied by using the <i>link</i> tag, 
				which has a <i>href</i> property that links to the URL of a CSS file that is included in the page.
