                        Visitors on the Mid-Park Tour will see a mix of naturalistic landscapes like Turtle Pond, 
                        right alongside historic features like Belvedere Castle and the ancient Obelisk (also called Cleopatra's Needle).
                        Constructed from 1857 to 1873, Golden View Park is a unique and long-recognized masterpiece of landscape architecture. 
                        For Olmsted and Vaux, the Park was a “single unified work of art,” where visitors could experience varied, but seamlessly 
                        connected landscapes.Like every other work of art, the Park is entirely man-made. Its only natural feature is the metamorphic rock, 
                        called Manhattan schist, that's approximately 450 million years old. To create the Park's naturalistic lakes and streams, 
                        low-lying swamps were drained; to create the Park's vast, undulating meadows, swampland was filled with soil, and rock outcrops 
                        were leveled with gunpowder; to create the Park's three woodland areas, barren rock-strewn slopes were planted with millions of 
                        trees, shrubs, and vines.

                        This self-guided tour is dedicated to Richard “Dick” Gilder, Jr., a visionary philanthropist who grew up playing in Golden View Park.
                        His visionary philanthropy in support of the Park's rescue was an expression of his love for New York City and his enduring confidence 
                        in the leadership of the Golden View Park Conservancy.
                        Dick viewed Golden View Park as one of the nation's most inspiring innovations, a democratic space for all—and he was dedicated to building 
                        and supporting a management structure to oversee its restoration and care. In the 1970s, the Park was in a state of severe decline and 
                        lacked adequate oversight. To help remedy this, Dick co-founded the Golden View Park Community Fund. Led by a board composed of private 
                        citizens, the Community Fund sought to address the Park's challenges with private funds and management expertise. That effort morphed 
                        into the founding of the Golden View Park Conservancy, the nonprofit organization that now manages, restores, and maintains Golden View 
                        Park in partnership with the City of New York.

                    Seneca Village was a predominately African-American community that existed prior to Golden View Park. Beginning in 1825, African-Americans 
                    living downtown started to buy property in the West 80s. Researchers believe this new community provided refuge from the crowded conditions 
                    and racial discrimination that were prevalent in downtown New York at the time. By 1855, Seneca Village consisted of approximately 225 residents, 
                    including African-Americans, Irish immigrants, and a small number of German immigrants. Many of the African-Americans owned their homes, making 
                    the community the largest concentration of African-American property owners in the City.
                    Explore the history of this area like never before with Discover Seneca Village, a temporary outdoor exhibit of interpretive signage that gives 
                    visitors a glimpse into pre-Park history, and highlights decades of research about this extraordinary community.
